# Module 5 Challenge Summary

In this week's module we were challenged with analyzing PyBer's ride data by city type. The three types were rural, suburban and urban. We used two CSV files in our analysis and ultimately created two dataframes from which we gathered data by city type and evalutated the performance of each type. 

## Urban 
This was the largest subset of data, where we found that there were 1,625 total rides and 2,405 total drivers. The total amount of fares collected was $39,865 with an average fare per ride of $24.53 and average fare per driver at $16.57. This data had the lowest average fare per fide and average fare per driver.

## Suburban
This was the second largest subset of data, coming with 625 rices, 490 total drivers and $19,356 in total fares collected. This had the second highest highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 

## Rural
This was the smallest of the dataset by a lot. With only 125 rides and 78 drivers, the rural dataset collected $4,327 in total fares. The average fare per driver and average fare per ride for this dataset was much larger. 

### Challenges 

My main pain point in this module challenge was definitely formatting. After getting the right data it was a major struggle for me to format my dataframe without running into TypeErrors and other types of errors. I decided to just round the vaues in the dataframe instead of trying to formatting and ruining the whole analysis.
